# AI-ML-academy

## Modules covered so far (in order):
### classic-cv:
  - my task was to prepare an example of homography transformation for a domain of my choice, which hasn't been already covered during the academy (overlaying the company's logo on a parallelogram seen at an angle, homography of two maps of the same place GIS from a bird's eye view, in a different projection, two images of a room with a change in the X axis - joining at common keypoints, creating BirdEyeView based on two images from a car's camera). For this purpose I prepared an AR homography example, with possibility to apply an image onto a Pantone card with markers - either from photo or by using a webcam.
### advanced-statistical-learning:
Notebooks developed by me during Advanced Statistical Learning module. Descriptions of homework can be found in each of the notebooks. Most of the topics covered in the notebooks:
- setting up estimate confidence intervals & student's test for model evaluation
- comparison of results for ensembles of different Gradient Boosting implementations
- comparison of results for different ensemble methods: voting, soft voting, bagging, stacking
- overfitting/underfitting models on purpose & verification
- hypertuning
- mixture of experts (moe)
- confidence ellipsoids for different linear regression models - for both bootstrap and jackknife - and comparison
- pseudo-labeling & noisy-student implementations
